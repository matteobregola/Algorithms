# Description

This folder contains the implementation of a binary tree.

> ### What is a binary tree?
> A  binary tree is a tree that has only a leftchild and rightchild
>
> ### What about the implementation?
> There are two possible solutions:
> 1. Using arrays
> 2. Using linked lists:
>       In this option we can choose to have information only about the 
>       children of the tree or even of the parent. The solution provided
>       does not contain info about the parents. But is a **search binary tree**,
>       this means that on the left subtree there are only values minor than the root
>       while in the right subtree there are only values major than the root.
