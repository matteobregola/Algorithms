# Maximum Subsequence sum: 

Given a Vector of Integers A[] the three algorithms will evaluate the sum of the elements 
that represent the maximum contineous subsequence 

The first file contains three different implementations

The second file contains only the linear one with the usage of an input and output

## Complexity:
- maxsum1 is O(n^3)
- maxsum2 is O(n^2)
- maxsum3 is O(n)
